## Self-Assessment and Reflection

This section reflects on my personal learning journey, technical growth, and professional development throughout the XR industrial project. [cite_start]Rather than only describing completed tasks, this reflection focuses on how my skills, mindset, and approach to teamwork evolved over the duration of the project[cite: 320, 321].

### What Went Well

[cite_start]One of the strongest aspects of my contribution was taking ownership of complex and high-impact technical components, particularly Node-RED logic design and real-time data integration[cite: 323]. [cite_start]I learnt Unity part in such a short time to work successfully on live data part for the Unit and worked on it successfully[cite: 324]. [cite_start]I successfully designed, extended, and stabilized multiple Node-RED flows/ Unity codes that served as the backbone of the entire system, connecting the PLC, InfluxDB, and Unity XR application[cite: 325].

[cite_start]My proactive communication with both the backend and Unity teams ensured that integration challenges were identified early[cite: 326]. [cite_start]Acting as a bridge between different technical domains helped reduce misunderstandings and allowed the team to converge on a working solution faster[cite: 327]. [cite_start]Additionally, my role in preparing the final live demo and presentation ensured that the system was not only functional but also demonstrable in a clear and convincing manner[cite: 328].

### What Was Challenging

[cite_start]The most significant challenge was managing the complexity of a distributed real-time system[cite: 330]. [cite_start]Issues often arose not from individual components, but from their interaction such as timing mismatches, inconsistent payload structures, or unstable network behavior[cite: 331]. [cite_start]There were challeneges in every sprint like[cite: 332]:
* [cite_start]OPCUA connection issues [cite: 333]
* [cite_start]Node-red/Influx connections [cite: 334]
* [cite_start]Unity live data integrations [cite: 335]

[cite_start]Another challenge was balancing technical depth with time constraints[cite: 338]. [cite_start]As new requirements emerged, particularly additional machine variables and XR features, I had to rapidly adapt existing logic without introducing regressions[cite: 338]. [cite_start]Coordinating final integration across multiple subsystems during the last sprint was particularly demanding[cite: 339].

### Skills Developed

[cite_start]Throughout the project, I developed several technical and professional skills[cite: 341]:

* [cite_start]Real-time data processing and system integration using Node-RED and OPC UA [cite: 342]
* [cite_start]Time-series data handling and querying using InfluxDB [cite: 343]
* [cite_start]Live data integration and debugging within Unity XR applications [cite: 344]
* [cite_start]Unity wise scene work and animations integration. [cite: 345]
* [cite_start]Debugging distributed systems across hardware, backend, and frontend layers [cite: 346]
* [cite_start]Agile and Scrum-based teamwork, including sprint planning and retrospectives [cite: 347]
* [cite_start]Technical communication and documentation for cross-team collaboration [cite: 348]

### What I Would Do Differently

[cite_start]If given the opportunity to repeat the project, I would prioritize defining stricter data contracts earlier in the process, including standardized variable naming, data types, and payload formats[cite: 350]. [cite_start]This would have reduced integration overhead later[cite: 351].

[cite_start]I would also prototype XR UI elements earlier using live or simulated data to better assess usability constraints specific to XR environments, such as readability, cognitive load, and user attention[cite: 352].

### Learning from Scrum and Teamwork

[cite_start]Working within a Scrum-inspired structure reinforced the importance of incremental progress, transparency, and continuous feedback[cite: 354]. [cite_start]Sprint reviews and informal retrospectives helped identify bottlenecks early and encouraged shared ownership of the final outcome[cite: 355]. [cite_start]I learned that successful technical leadership involves not only solving problems personally, but also enabling others to work effectively[cite: 356].
