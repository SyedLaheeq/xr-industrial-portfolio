# Peer Review and Group Feedback

Before finalizing this Individual Project Portfolio, I circulated a draft among my project group members and received feedback regarding both content and clarity.

---

## Feedback Received

The main feedback points included:

- The need for clearer explanation of how Node-RED logic scaled as more variables were added.
- Suggestions to better highlight my individual responsibility for Unity live data integration.
- Requests for clearer visual evidence linking backend data to XR output.

## Response to Feedback

- **Node-RED Logic Clarity:** I agreed with this feedback and expanded the contribution logs to explicitly describe how additional variables were integrated, validated, and exposed through unified endpoints.

- **Unity Responsibility Visibility:** I clarified my sole responsibility for the Unity live data integration in both the contribution log and reflection sections, emphasizing ownership and technical decision-making.

- **Visual Evidence:** I added placeholders for screenshots, flow diagrams, and Unity captures throughout the portfolio to strengthen traceability between backend work and XR visualization.

All feedback was carefully considered, and changes were made where they improved clarity, traceability, or alignment with assessment criteria.
