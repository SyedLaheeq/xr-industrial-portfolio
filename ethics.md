# Benefits, Limitations, System Requirements & Ethics

## Benefits
- Faster error identification
- Reduced downtime
- Improved operator awareness
- XR training potential

## Limitations
- Network dependency
- XR hardware constraints
- Scalability concerns

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- XR headset
- PLC-connected machine
- Backend server

### Software
- Unity XR Toolkit
- Node-RED
- InfluxDB
- OPC UA tools

## Ethical Considerations (Stakeholder Matrix)

- **Operators:** Awareness vs overload  
- **Maintenance:** Diagnostics vs dependency  
- **Management:** Efficiency vs data misuse  
- **Developers:** Safety and transparency  

## Ethical Reflection
- Data privacy & access control
- XR must not distract operators
- Transparency in error logic
- XR as decision support, not replacement
